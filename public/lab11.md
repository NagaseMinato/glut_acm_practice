## 实验题目:POJ：DNA Sorting

This summary was auto generated by python, you could found it at **https://github.com/cthulhujk/glut_acm_practice**.

## 1.Lab Topic
+ POJ：DNA Sorting
> One measure of ``unsortedness'' in a sequence is the number of pairs of entries that are out of order with respect to each other. For instance, in the letter sequence ``DAABEC'', this measure is 5, since D is greater than four letters to its right and E is greater than one letter to its right. This measure is called the number of inversions in the sequence. The sequence ``AACEDGG'' has only one inversion (E and D)---it is nearly sorted---while the sequence ``ZWQM'' has 6 inversions (it is as unsorted as can be---exactly the reverse of sorted). 

## 2.Requirement Analysis
输入N个M长度的DNA序列字符，输出从最无序到最有序的字符串，注意该序列是题目指定的inversion number排序

## 3.APIs Design
```cpp
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
/// Public Interface: Note that these interfaces were even not actually
/// APIs which could be called by other functions.
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

      //@summary 求解特殊的排序值
      //@param str待排序的字符串
      //@return int 特殊排序值
      int inversionNumber(const std::string & str)
```
## 4.Detail Design
输入字符串，使用子过程计算特殊的排序结果（即inversion number sort），并与字符串本身一同存放至multimap（因为key可能重复，不能使用map），由于multimap是有序红黑树，最终迭代输出结果即可。
```cpp
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
/// Pseudocode implementations: implementation details of program
/// described by pseudocode. Its syntax was familiar to Python.
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

globalMap = {}//std::multimap

userInput = getUserInput()
while userInput != end :
    sortedValue = inversionNumber(userInput)
    store [input,sortedValue] into globalMap
    userInput = getUserInput()

for [key,value] in globalMap.items():
    print key,",",value
    
```

## 5.Building and running
I have A LOT free time to do uesless work. Obviously this project can easily use g++/clang compiled for all, but I still write a cmake rules to make it more engineered and modernization, even in previous you could see manual makefile. Notice that this project was licensed under [MIT License](LICENSE), which means you can do almost everything you want with it. Anyway, I just want to make it more fun :-)

Prerequisite:
+ unix make
+ g++ version >= 4.8.4
+ git
+ cmake >= 3.5.0

For linux users:
```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/NagaseMinato/glut_acm_practice.git
$ cd glut_acm_practice/build
$ cmake .. -G"Unix Makefiles"
$ make -j8
$ ../bin/poj_1007_40percentAC  # try to run a built program
$ make clean
```
There are more details about each programs in testsuites, you can run it to see more if you had been installed `valgrind` toolchain:
```shell
$ sudo apt-get install valgrind
$ make test         # run testsuite
```
For windows users:
```
> git clone https://github.com/NagaseMinato/glut_acm_practice.git
> cd glut_acm_practice/build
> cmake .. -G"Visual Studio 15 2017"
```
Then double-click `glut_acm_practice.sln`, select a sub project and build it, enjoy it!

## 6.Test Output
One measure of ``unsortedness'' in a sequence is the number of pairs of entries that are out of order with respect to each other. For instance, in the letter sequence ``DAABEC'', this measure is 5, since D is greater than four letters to its right and E is greater than one letter to its right. This measure is called the number of inversions in the sequence. The sequence ``AACEDGG'' has only one inversion (E and D)---it is nearly sorted---while the sequence ``ZWQM'' has 6 inversions (it is as unsorted as can be---exactly the reverse of sorted).

## 7.Appendix
+ All programs had been passed my own test cases, you can add/modify/delete testcases into corresponding test/*.data file. For me, I eliminated all warnings and memory leaking using [valgrind](http://valgrind.org/)
+ For more information about how to run these test, see `# 5.Usage` section
