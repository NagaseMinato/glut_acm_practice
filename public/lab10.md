## 实验题目:POJ：Hangover

This summary was auto generated by python, you could found it at **https://github.com/cthulhujk/glut_acm_practice**.

## 1.Lab Topic
+ POJ：Hangover
> How far can you make a stack of cards overhang a table? If you have one card, you can create a maximum overhang of half a card length. (We're assuming that the cards must be perpendicular to the table.) With two cards you can make the top card overhang the bottom one by half a card length, and the bottom one overhang the table by a third of a card length, for a total maximum overhang of 1/2 + 1/3 = 5/6 card lengths. In general you can make n cards overhang by 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + ... + 1/(n + 1) card lengths, where the top card overhangs the second by 1/2, the second overhangs tha third by 1/3, the third overhangs the fourth by 1/4, etc., and the bottom card overhangs the table by 1/(n + 1). This is illustrated in the figure below.

## 2.Requirement Analysis
输入一个浮点数，计算调和级数，直到大于等于输入的数字则输出。

## 3.APIs Design
```cpp
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
/// Public Interface: Note that these interfaces were even not actually
/// APIs which could be called by other functions.
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

      //@summary No public APIs provided
      //@param void none
      //@return void none
      static void NoneExportedAPI(void);
```
## 4.Detail Design
所有计算在main中进行。判断用户输入不为0.00时计算调和级数，直到调和级数和大于用户输入则输出
```cpp
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
/// Pseudocode implementations: implementation details of program
/// described by pseudocode. Its syntax was familiar to Python.
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

while (f != 0.00):
  float sum = 0.0;
  for (i = 2; sum < f; i++) {
      sum += (1.0 / i);
  }
  output sum
  get user input
```

## 5.Building and running
I have A LOT free time to do uesless work. Obviously this project can easily use g++/clang compiled for all, but I still write a cmake rules to make it more engineered and modernization, even in previous you could see manual makefile. Notice that this project was licensed under [MIT License](LICENSE), which means you can do almost everything you want with it. Anyway, I just want to make it more fun :-)

Prerequisite:
+ unix make
+ g++ version >= 4.8.4
+ git
+ cmake >= 3.5.0

For linux users:
```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/NagaseMinato/glut_acm_practice.git
$ cd glut_acm_practice/build
$ cmake .. -G"Unix Makefiles"
$ make -j8
$ ../bin/poj_1003_48percentAC  # try to run a built program
$ make clean
```
There are more details about each programs in testsuites, you can run it to see more if you had been installed `valgrind` toolchain:
```shell
$ sudo apt-get install valgrind
$ make test         # run testsuite
```
For windows users:
```
> git clone https://github.com/NagaseMinato/glut_acm_practice.git
> cd glut_acm_practice/build
> cmake .. -G"Visual Studio 15 2017"
```
Then double-click `glut_acm_practice.sln`, select a sub project and build it, enjoy it!

## 6.Test Output
How far can you make a stack of cards overhang a table? If you have one card, you can create a maximum overhang of half a card length. (We're assuming that the cards must be perpendicular to the table.) With two cards you can make the top card overhang the bottom one by half a card length, and the bottom one overhang the table by a third of a card length, for a total maximum overhang of 1/2 + 1/3 = 5/6 card lengths. In general you can make n cards overhang by 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + ... + 1/(n + 1) card lengths, where the top card overhangs the second by 1/2, the second overhangs tha third by 1/3, the third overhangs the fourth by 1/4, etc., and the bottom card overhangs the table by 1/(n + 1). This is illustrated in the figure below.

## 7.Appendix
+ All programs had been passed my own test cases, you can add/modify/delete testcases into corresponding test/*.data file. For me, I eliminated all warnings and memory leaking using [valgrind](http://valgrind.org/)
+ For more information about how to run these test, see `# 5.Usage` section
