## 实验题目:POJ：Palindromes

This summary was auto generated by python, you could found it at **https://github.com/cthulhujk/glut_acm_practice**.

## 1.Lab Topic
+ POJ：Palindromes
> A regular palindrome is a string of numbers or letters that is the same forward as backward. For example, the string "ABCDEDCBA" is a palindrome because it is the same when the string is read from left to right as when the string is read from right to left.A mirrored string is a string for which when each of the elements of the string is changed to its reverse (if it has a reverse) and the string is read backwards the result is the same as the original string. For example, the string "3AIAE" is a mirrored string because "A" and "I" are their own reverses, and "3" and "E" are each others' reverses.  

## 2.Requirement Analysis
输入N个字符串，输出字符串是否为回文字符串;对字符串进行操作和根据题目进行计算

## 3.APIs Design
```cpp
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
/// Public Interface: Note that these interfaces were even not actually
/// APIs which could be called by other functions.
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

        //@summary No public APIs provided
        //@param void none
        //@return void none
        static void NoneExportedAPI(void);
```
## 4.Detail Design
回文字处理，使用硬编码直接将题目要求的回文数字/字符写入代码，方便后面计算；特殊天气计算按照题目描述计算即可，由于缺少其他情况，故程序不完全符合题目要求。
```cpp
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
/// Pseudocode implementations: implementation details of program
/// described by pseudocode. Its syntax was familiar to Python.
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

       //no pseudocode provided
      
```

## 5.Building and running
I have A LOT free time to do uesless work. Obviously this project can easily use g++/clang compiled for all, but I still write a cmake rules to make it more engineered and modernization, even in previous you could see manual makefile. Notice that this project was licensed under [MIT License](LICENSE), which means you can do almost everything you want with it. Anyway, I just want to make it more fun :-)

Prerequisite:
+ unix make
+ g++ version >= 4.8.4
+ git
+ cmake >= 3.5.0

For linux users:
```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/NagaseMinato/glut_acm_practice.git
$ cd glut_acm_practice/build
$ cmake .. -G"Unix Makefiles"
$ make -j8
$ ../bin/poj_1590_33percentAC  # try to run a built program
$ make clean
```
There are more details about each programs in testsuites, you can run it to see more if you had been installed `valgrind` toolchain:
```shell
$ sudo apt-get install valgrind
$ make test         # run testsuite
```
For windows users:
```
> git clone https://github.com/NagaseMinato/glut_acm_practice.git
> cd glut_acm_practice/build
> cmake .. -G"Visual Studio 15 2017"
```
Then double-click `glut_acm_practice.sln`, select a sub project and build it, enjoy it!

## 6.Test Output
A regular palindrome is a string of numbers or letters that is the same forward as backward. For example, the string "ABCDEDCBA" is a palindrome because it is the same when the string is read from left to right as when the string is read from right to left.A mirrored string is a string for which when each of the elements of the string is changed to its reverse (if it has a reverse) and the string is read backwards the result is the same as the original string. For example, the string "3AIAE" is a mirrored string because "A" and "I" are their own reverses, and "3" and "E" are each others' reverses.

## 7.Appendix
+ All programs had been passed my own test cases, you can add/modify/delete testcases into corresponding test/*.data file. For me, I eliminated all warnings and memory leaking using [valgrind](http://valgrind.org/)
+ For more information about how to run these test, see `# 5.Usage` section
